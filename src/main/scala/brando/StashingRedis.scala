/**
 * This actor implements Akka stashing to stash requests to Redis when the connection
 * is not established. Instead of direct invocation of the Brando, which throws an
 * exception, this actor stashes all requests and passes them to the Brando when the
 * connection is established. It avoids exceptions during the Brando startup or when
 * the connection is temporarily broken down.
 *
 * Note: This actor re-enables the behavior of the Brando in version 2.x.x
 *
 * To use it:
 *
 * 1. create Brando actor
 * 2. create this actor with the Brando as parameter
 * 3. use this actor to querying redis
